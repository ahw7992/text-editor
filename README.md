# text-editor

Welcome to my replication of antirez's kilo! This is for my first project in my CYB-3053 Operating Systems course.

---

# In order to run:
- Open terminal (must be Linux- or maxOS-based; Windows will not work due to termios.h)
- git clone https://github.com/ahw7992/text-editor.git
- cd into the new directory, ./text-editor
- run 'make'
- run ./kilo
  
Congratulations, the Kilo text editor is now open!
